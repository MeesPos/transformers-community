# Transformers Community

Transformers Community is a dashboard where young people can talk/share things with each other. These are young people who are between 16 and 27 years old and who are engaged in personal development. This could be, for example, insecure young people. The aim is for young people to feel that they are not alone, and to be able to talk about it and share their feelings.
